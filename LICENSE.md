# WYVERNSCALE SOURCE CODE LICENSE v2.0

COPYRIGHT (c) 2016, Felix Hirn

This license may only be copied verbatim, not in modified form.



## 1. Terms And Definitions

* A software's __user__ is anybody permitted to make use of the software in some
way further specified by its license.

* __Source code__ is the preferred form of editing the software.

* __Free software__ is software that grants its users at least the following
  rights and guarantees, revokable only if the user breaks the license
  agreement:

  1. The right to use the software in any way, privately or with other users.

  2. The right to share the unmodified software with other users, in any form.

  3. The right and unobstructed possibility to view and modify the program's
     source code.

  4. The right to share said modifications with other users. Individual licenses
     may specify restrictions on how these modifications are to be released, as
     long as the resulting conditions still satisfy the definition of free
     software.

* __Functional modifications__ are modifications that alter the behaviour of the
  software in a nontrivial way.



## 2. Rights Granted To Users

The licensed software is free software as described above, under the following
terms:

* Becoming a user of the software is not tied to any conditions.

* Functionally unmodified parts in any form must be distributed with this
  license or any of its future versions, if explicitly allowed by the software's
  author.

* Functionally modified parts may be released under any free software license,
  as long as they are clearly labelled as modifications so that they cannot be
  confused with the unmodified version.



## 3. Disclaimer

The licensed software is to be regarded as an awful, insecure, barely-working
hack job.  It should only be used in a secured environment that prevents the
software from causing any harm, including, but not limited to damage from
unexpected side effects or refusal to run at all.  Any potential damage caused
by the software is to blame on failure to implement sufficient safety measures
and therefore on the user, not on the developer of the software.
