This license may only be copied verbatim, not in modified form.



The user is granted the following rights:

 1. The freedom to run the software however he wants.

 2. The freedom to study and modify the software's source code however he wants.

 3. The freedom to redistribute the software in unmodified form, as long as
    it stays under the original license and the copyright notice stays attached.
    Distribution of compiled versions is permitted as long as the users are
    granted unobstructed access to the source code as well.

 4. The freedom to distribute modified versions of the software, as long as the
    modifications are also released under the original license or future
    versions of it and are clearly marked in a way so that they cannot be
    confused with the original.

 5. The freedom to use parts or the entirety of the software for his own. Any
    software that directly or indirectly depends on this software must be
    released under a license that also grants the user the rights 1-3 defined
    above as well as rights 4 and 5, possibly with some differing restrictions
    as to under which license derived software is to be released.



The licensed software is to be regarded as an awful, insecure, barely-working
hack job.  It should only be used in a secured environment that prevents the
software from causing any damage, including, but not limited to damage from
unexpected side effects or refusal to run at all.  Any potential damage caused
by the software is to blame on failure to implement sufficient safety measures
and therefore on the user, not on the developer of the software.
